# Portfolio

## Description
An introduction of myself, and the showing some of my projects. 

### User Story


AS A potential employee 
I WANT to show a potential employers deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT they can review samples of my work and assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position



### Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:


GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with the developer's applications
WHEN I click on the Live link of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
